## ðŸš€ Overview
Our mission at Flexport is to make trade easy for everyone. For those of us charged with building the technologies to realize that mission, this means creating intuitive, scalable, and reliable experiences that users love. The foundation for those experiences is our design system: Latitude.

Latitude was created to give Flexport a standard set of design principles and elements. It provides flexibility to design a diverse range of user-delighting products. It is a common visual language that ensures quality and consistency â€“ aligned with our brand, across our organization. Whatâ€™s more, Latitude helps us work efficiently, without having to continually recreate assets or patterns.

Weâ€™ve built Latitude to drive great user experiences with the flexibility to foster innovation. Learn more from our [introductory blog post][1].

ðŸ“£ Flexport engineers: we believe that our design system is strongest when everyone
contributes. Check out the [contributing doc][2] for a getting started guide.

## ðŸ“š Documentation

- The site is built from our monorepo (for now) but component docs are generated from the sourcecode in this repo!
